# moving-icon

# Project Description
This repo will hold a project where I will attempt to recreate a really impressive icon I saw on a loading page.<br>
Similar design features were used in a coding project I viewed a week ago;<br>
the source code is available for me to study, so my hope is to figure out which CSS framework was utilized.<br>
Then, I hope to find something close to the icon and attempt to add the relevant features to it.<br>
<br>
Ideally, waves should "echo" out from it in all directions at even intervals;<br>
the icon itself should appear to flicker, or change in opacity.<br>

# Notes
It appears I may be able to do much of what I want my creating a pretty basic gif;<br>
I will experiment with that, host it here, and continue to work on something more advanced as time permits.<br>

# Remaining Work
