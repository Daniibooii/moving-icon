# moving-icon

# Project Description
This repo will hold a project where I will attempt to recreate a really impressive icon I saw on a loading page.<br>
Similar design features were used in a group project presented a week ago;<br>
all of the class projects are available for viewing, so my hope is to figure out which CSS framework was utilized.<br>
Then, I hope to find something close to the icon and attempt to add the relevant features to it.<br>
<br>
Ideally, waves should "echo" out from it in all directions at even intervals;<br>
the icon itself should appear to flicker, or change in opacity.<br>
<br>
This, and most of the other repos created today, represent side projects.<br>
It remains to be seen how much time I am able to devote to them during my bootcamp,<br>
or if they capture my interest enough for me to invest in them afterwards.<br>
